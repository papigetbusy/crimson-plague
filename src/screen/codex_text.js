    hound: 'Fast and fragile. Runs you down quickly and bites twice as often, but dies to one or two good hits.',
    golem: 'A slow wall of stone with a huge pile of health and a heavy blow. Slide away from it and keep shooting.',
    goblin: 'Small, quick and weak. Comes in numbers early on; easy kills that fill your XP bar.',
    skeleton: 'Tough bones and a slow, heavy swing with a long wind-up: you can step out of reach before it lands.',
    mushroom: 'Stays back and spits slow globs of spore at you. Dodge the glob, then shoot it.',
    eyeball: 'Floats above the ground and fires fast bolts from long range. Hard to hit while you run; stop and aim.',
    flame: 'A floating fire spirit that hurls slow fireballs and hits harder than most. Keep moving sideways.',
    bat: 'The Bat Lord, one of the four bosses at the end of a floor (picked at random). A fast flyer that circles you, rears up, then dives through the spot where you stood: a lane glows on the floor first, so step aside or slide through. A dive that lands drains your health into his. Calls bats at half health and enrages under a third.',
    lich: 'The Lich King, one of the four bosses. He keeps his distance, fires a fan of soul bolts and a ring of bolts with gaps (find a gap, or slide), blinks away when you get close and raises the dead at 60% health.',
    dragon: 'The Elder Dragon, one of the four bosses. He stands his ground: a sweeping cone of fire (lanes show where it will go; step out of it) and a tail slam that shocks everything close (a ring shows its reach). Slow, huge and very tough.',
    demon: 'The Demon Lord, one of the four bosses at the end of a floor (picked at random). He sleeps at the door until you come close or hurt him, then charges, throws fireballs, calls hounds at half health and goes into a rage under about a third of his health. He always drops a gun and a piece of gear, a rarity band better than normal.'

    ['Levels and skills', 'Killing monsters drops XP. Each level-up gives you two picks: one class skill and one ordinary stat card. Class skills level up from use as well as from picking them again.'],
    ['Guns', 'You start with a silver pistol. Guns drop from monsters (more from elites, a sure drop from bosses). You carry two and swap between them. A gun lying on the floor is only picked up when you press pick up, so a good gun is never lost by accident. Hearts and flames are still picked up by walking over them.'],
    ['Gear', 'Armor (head, chest, boots) and two charms drop too. Armor gives defense and health, charms give nothing until their affixes roll. Like guns, gear on the floor is only picked up when you press pick up, and a piece you pick up goes on in its place, with the old piece dropping at your feet. The floor card tells you if it is better or worse than what you wear.'],
    ['Traps', 'Spikes, flame vents and rising spikes hurt you for a share of your health, and hurt monsters too. They get nastier on deeper floors.'],
    ['Fog', 'From wave 3 some ordinary waves roll in fog that cuts how far you can see. It thickens and lifts slowly, and the game announces it.'],
